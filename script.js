// Javascript is a high-level, prototype-based object-oriented, multi-paradigm, interpreted or just in time compiled, dynamic, single-threaded, garbage-collected programming language with first-class functions and a non-blocking event loop concurrency model.

/*Multi-Paradigm 
- Procedural Programming
- Objected-Oriented Programming
- Functional Programming.
JS does all the above. Paradigm could also be imperative or declarative.
Almost everything in JS is an Object except for primitive values (e.g strings, numbers)

// FIRST-CLASS FUNCTIONS
Functions are simply treated as variables. They can be passed into other functions, and return them from functions.

// DYNAMIC
JS is dynamically typed, you do not have to assign data type to variables, rather they become known during code execution.
